## Quick Start

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) with your browser to see the result.

If the system show such an error: `you haven’t install ‘next’ yet`, then run the command below:

```
npm install next react react-dom
```

Actually, there are many other modules need to be downloaded before you can run the project, just follow the warnings and download these modules.
