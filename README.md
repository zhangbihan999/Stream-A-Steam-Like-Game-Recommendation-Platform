This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

### Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

If the system say that you haven’t install ‘next’ yet, then run the following command to install:

```
npm install next react react-dom
```

Then run:

```
npm run dev
```

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
